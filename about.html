        Hello, it's nice to have you here. I am John Fáwọlé, a Blockchain Content Marketer. In the next couple of paragraphs, I'd be telling you a bit about myself and how I can ship your blockchain project into limelight with result-driven content marketing strategies.
I have two distinct personalities that help me in generating results for my blockchain clients - I am both a blockchain native and content marketing expert. As a blockchain native, I have—among other things—interacted with various DeFi protocols and exchanges. Sometimes, when I am less busy, I grind for NFT WL on Discord - I have two WL spots at the moment of writing (winks).
It is safe to say that I have immersed myself into every activity in this ecosystem. Why am I telling you this? The reason is simple:
You'd agree with me that no one can write about what he neither knows nor understands. Whenever I write about anything relating to blockchain, I write with hands-on experience. That makes me connect faster with the readers and provide top-tier value

        <h1>My experience</h1>
        <p>
            Now, let's move on to my experience as a content marketing expert. First, when I call myself an expert, I don't mean to brag. But let's face it, I'm damn good at what I do, so it's simply the truth!
I started my marketing career when I worked at a Digital Marketing Agency as an in-house content marketer for almost a year. From there, I have contributed to the content marketing campaigns of various projects like Xbullion, NFTify, and Ekoios Technologies.
